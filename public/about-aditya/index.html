		<h1>About me.</h1>
		<div class="content">
			<p>Imagine a forty-eight inch white stretched canvas. Grainy in texture and void of hue. An artist meanders his careful fingers across the board, picturing the first stroke of deep-magenta his brush will trail across. He is nervous, excited. He picks his brush but unsure if he’s ready to break the comfort the bleakness provides him with, he puts his brush back down. The stroke will mark a beginning: a definitive step in a direction, one that nobody can reverse. The infiniteness of what the canvas could possibly entail would forever be lost. More still, the artist cannot afford another canvas, all he’s got is this one; naturally, he wants to begin it “the right way”.</p>
<p>Can you call this situation difficult? or one that is just so simple to escape? Literally, you can do <em>anything</em>, start anywhere; the catch however is that you cannot do <em>everything</em>. Data Science, machine learning, and development-of-all-sorts magnetizes me, and in them, I see the hue I like. Thus, the first stroke –my attempt to pursue them– howsoever meagre howsoever pale, now sits on the canvas. And so, you see this website. Am I starting the right way? Is making a website all that necessary? Am I naïve in trying to learn a specialisation like data-science that generally graduate students do? Is taking a defer semester from university alright? Did I just use the right analogy to explain my situation? I frankly know little, just as much as I care. All I know is that the hue looks beautiful sitting on the canvas, and the very stroke encourages me to work harder, throw more good paint out there. I am out to experiment.</p>
<p>Well, what has this to do with the website, you ask?</p>
<p>I’ve built this website to encapsulate or, at the very least, reflect what I learn, how I grow. Also, as one of my very good friend had suggested, “it’s always a good idea to control one’s own online presence”. So, why not create a website?, I ask. Now, how will it look like in the future? What kind of content will it reside? are question only time can/will answer. “You cannot connect the dots looking forward, you can only connect them looking backward. So, you have to trust in something, your gut, karma, destiny…”, following the words of my ideal, I am trusting my gut. I am as excited as ignorant about how this will go as you who are reading it. Yet, why hold back from trying?</p>
<p>Some thoughts on what this place may possibly reside:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Me trying to explain complex topics in simpler words as I learn more: Yes, teach. Why?  Ever tried tutoring a dumb friend on a math concept? Distilling simple explanations of highly complex topics is no easy task. And while teaching,  one is likely to stumble upon a caveat in his/her own understanding, and I look forward to such learning opportunities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Documenting the projects I create: Project are fun and exciting just to create, and documentation often is “boring part”. However, what happens when you don’t it? One, when you look back from 2 years into the future, your memory isn’t good enough to recall everything you had created, how you had created. Documentation aids memory, and more importantly significantly boosts your confidence levels. You leave no dark caves in your project, or at least if you do, you are aware they exist. It also helps the world see what you have made. So again, why not?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learn to influence: It often turns out that the <strong>mere knowledge</strong> of an idea/concept that spins beautifully inside my head doesn&rsquo;t translate into my abilities to <strong>convey</strong> the same thought to someone else. Thus, here I may try to learn to convey ideas effectively, convincingly, and concisely. To learn to write and express thoughts such that they influence. To write to make a difference.</p>
